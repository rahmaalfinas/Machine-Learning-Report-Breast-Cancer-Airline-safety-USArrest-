In this repository, I uploaded a Machine Learning Report for Breast Cancer, Airline Safety, and USArrest Dataset. The report was divided in three tasks, one dataset for one task. Logistic Regression, Decision tree, K-Means Clustering, and Hierarchical clustering were used to complete the tasks. I utilised PCA and feature importance to reduce the dimension of data but still keeping the variance, then compare it to the original to see which one perform better.
